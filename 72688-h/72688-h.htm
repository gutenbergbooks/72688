</div>

<p class="dropcap">One, two, three—five men that call themselves
my friends, all wishful to borrow money!
Statilius, you will please to make a note of these five
gentlemen, and give orders that on no account are
they to pass my vestibule again. The settlement of
society under our Prince has done much to stamp out
the dangerous classes, but we have not yet got rid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the borrowers. I think it a little hard that after I
have neglected my estate for half my life to expel
roguery by the front door that it should creep in at
the back.</p>

<p>Did you inquire, Statilius, why my cook served
white sauce with quails last night? Very well; I
have made it a rule to deal with my people in person:
send for him. It is not possible to maintain a
household well regulated, unless the servants come
personally into touch with the master.</p>

<p>Plato, you served me last night a dish which, had
any of my friends been present, would have shamed
me forever. As it was, my dinner was ruined. It is
incompetence such as yours whose ill effects Rome
has struggled these eight lustrums to efface. You
will be sold in the market tomorrow. Go.</p>

<p>You see now, Statilius, the wisdom of my rule to
permit no freedman in my household: all my servants
are my own property. You will buy me the
best cook in Rome in three hours. What, sir? You
are a free man, and I employed you only to work at
my pedigree and my library? True: I am satisfied
with you. But understand that if I bid you litter
my horses you will do it, or I sell you up tomorrow.
Now, sir, the best cook in Rome is Iulus Antonius’s
Dama: buy him. Antonius is a rich man? Very
true, but I think we need not be afraid of that. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
can tempt him, I imagine, Statilius. At any price
whatever: do you understand? And not a penny
more than he will sell at: understand that also. If
he is stubborn, hint at my influence with the Prince;
that will be sufficient. Go.</p>

<p>Iulus knows that he is whispered against, and he
looks to me to prop him up. I shall not do so.
Again and again I have urged on Octavian the necessity
of putting these malcontents out of the way.
His father’s son cannot but be a danger to a settled
State, however soundly disposed himself. It appears
to me that Octavian is losing his aptitude for politics,
and Agrippa exercises the worst possible influence
upon him. This stupid, expensive system of banishment:
it should never have had my voice had I remained
in politics.</p>

<p>Thucydides, I have told you once already I am not
to be disturbed in meditation. The poet Horace is
in attendance? Horatius, I think you mean; avoid
these vulgarisms, Thucydides. Bid Horatius wait.
Indeed, I doubt not whether Octavian had at any
time any real grasp of the principles of government.
I was deceived by the facility with which he lent
himself to my views. He is a man incapable of understanding
any system between militarism and license.
Of the finer arts of statecraft I am afraid he
knows very little. How often have I explained to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
that man how the law of treason might be developed
into an infallible engine of sound government! Yes:
I was wise to leave politics, though Octavian is ungrateful
to his Mentor. Well, I will see Horatius.
He, at least, with all his faults, is a faithful soul. A
man I have made.</p>

<p>Good-day, Horatius. I hope you are well and
keeping sober. Have you brought the work I commissioned?
Very well; let me see it. There has
been a very great improvement in your manner of
writing, Horatius, since I took you up: the large
P’s are very much bolder than they were. But
what is this? This is not the Epistle Dedicatory I
ordered. That comes second? Ah! yes, here it is;
you should have given it to me first.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Maecenas, born of grandsire kings—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Quite right: “grandsire kings” is very good. It is
not, of course, literally correct, but one may, in
poetry, fairly write the particular term “grandsire”
for the general “ancestor”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O my defense and proud delight!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Proud delight.” Now I think I shall correct that
to “dear delight.” I think the alliteration is well
worth securing, and you may allow yourself a familiarity
in literature, Horatius, where all men are
equal, which, as I have no doubt you felt in writing,
would be highly unbecoming in society. “Proud delight”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
does you credit as a man, my good Horatius;
as a poet I permit—nay, I invite you to write “dear.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To hug the post with wheels afire</div>
  </div>

... ah! what is this?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But deign me so to canonize,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er highest heaven my fame will rise.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, very happy. A very good ode, Horatius. You
have distinctly added to your reputation. I am very
glad to note that you disavow that most dangerous tendency,
which I am sorry to see is growing among some
of my poets, to defer to the popular judgment. Even
poor Virgil is tainted by it in this last epic, as he
calls it, published in one of those measly magazinelets.
I am afraid Virgil is coming to think more of
the so-called glories of Rome than of his truest
friends. Such defection on your part, I warn you
candidly, I should feel very deeply. Now what is
this other? I hope none of that Epicurean stuff
which is such a handicap, if I may so phrase it, upon
your best powers for good....</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Since Death pursues with ruthless feet—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I think you might have found a fitter name than Postumus;
but it is very passable. I suppose you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
verified all these mythological allusions in the Greek;
it is not your industry I need ever distrust.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">The lordling of the little life.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yes, the tone of the work is quite good....
And then—really Horatius, you are too annoying—then
you must spoil all again in the last stanza. I
have warned you a thousand times against that, Horatius.
Listen, sir, to what you say here—</p>

<p class="noindent">Now, understand once and for all, Horatius, that I
will not have such pernicious and disloyal trash as
this put out to pollute the State. You say you meant
nothing impious? Well, then I will ask you, Horatius,
who is Chief Pontiff? The prince; so I had
thought. And then you say you had no intention of
disloyalty? In that case I will merely answer that
you have expressed yourself very badly. You will
agree, I suppose—even you who were out with Brutus,
when I understand you threw away your shield—that
what we must all work for in Rome, is a settled
social order? And I suppose that you are not incapable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
of perceiving that this is impossible without
the maintenance of religion? And perhaps you may
have heard that His Highness is supreme head of our
religion? And then, do you tell me, sir, that you did
not see that this last stanza—this Pontiff’s ambition,
or whatever it is—is pernicious in the highest degree?
Now this is what I shall do. I shall make you, Horatius,
write an ode of fourteen stanzas in praise of
His Highness as Chief Pontiff. Take your tablets
and write down the heads of the poem, as I dictate
them.</p>

<p>First: The deplorable desuetude.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon: I think I was asking you to
take down the heads of the ode. What! I? You
say that I gave you the subjects of this one? Very
possibly, though I do not remember: with the ode as
a whole I am very well satisfied. You say I gave the
hint of the Pontiff? Very true; I recollect it quite
well, but it was not to be used, or wasted, in the
spirit in which you have used it here. Perhaps,
however, you meant it to refer to the Pontiffs of the
old regime, whose unworthy excesses I may have
doubtless mentioned to you at some time? I could
wish, Horatius, that your execution were on a level
with your intention: you lay yourself open to a great
deal of misconstruction. I think we must substitute
“late” for “while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>What is that you are sputtering about Minucius?
I told you to glance at Minucius? Well, in one respect
you are quite right. I do not remember that I
ever spoke of him to you, but the extravagance of
Minucius not only makes him a man impossible to be
seen abroad with, but constitutes a great scandal on
the pontificate. And I tell you, sir, I tell you that
that man’s insolence to his betters is more than any
well-ordered State could endure. He has got the
Prince’s ear, and presumes upon it. Yes, you may
jab at Minucius whenever you can, and as hard as
you can. I am very glad I suggested that, and you
have taken up the hint very cleverly. Sit down, my
good Horatius; you must be tired of standing, and
we men of letters are all equal, whatever our social
position. I will read you a chapter of my own history
that I threw off last night. You will remember,
of course, what happened while I was Urban Prefect.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CAPTIVES">THE CAPTIVES.</h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Amongst them there was one colossal form, on
which the sun poured with its full radiance.</p>

<p>This was the form of a man grinding at a mill-stone;
the majestic, symmetrical, supple form of a
man who was also a god.</p>

<p>In his naked limbs there was a supreme power; in
his glance there was a divine command; his head
was lifted as though no yoke could ever lie on that
proud neck; his foot seemed to spurn the earth as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
though no mortal tie had ever bound him to the sod
that human steps bestrode: yet at the corn-mill he
laboured, grinding wheat like the patient blinded
oxen that toiled beside him.</p>

<p>It was the great Apollo in Pherae.</p>

<p>The hand which awoke the music of the spheres
had been blood stained with murder; the beauty
which had the light and lustre of the sun had been
darkened with passion and with crime; the will
which no other on earth or in heaven could withstand
had been bent under the chastisement of Zeus.</p>

<p>He whose glances had made the black and barren
slopes of Delos to laugh with fruitfulness and gladness—he
whose prophetic sight beheld all things
past, present, and to come, the fate of all unborn
races, the doom of all unspent ages—he, the Far-Striking
King, laboured here beneath the curse of
crime, greatest of all the gods, and yet a slave.</p>

<p>In all the hills and vales of Greece his Io paean
sounded still.</p>

<p>Upon his holy mountains there still arose the
smoke of fires of sacrifice.</p>

<p>With dance and song the Delian maidens still
hailed the divinity of Leto’s son.</p>

<p>The waves of the pure Ionian air still rang forever
with the name of Delphinios.</p>

<p>At Pytho and at Clarus, in Lycia and in Phodis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
his oracles still breathed forth upon their fiat terror
or hope into the lives of men; and still in all the
virgin forests of the world the wild beasts honored
him wheresoever they wandered; and the lion and
the bear came at his bidding from the deserts to
bend their necks and their wills of fire meekly to
bear his yoke in Thessaly.</p>

<p>Yet he labored here at the corn-mill of Admetus;
and watching him at his bondage stood the slender,
slight, wing-footed Hermes, with a slow, mocking
smile upon his knavish lips, and a jeering scorn in
his keen eyes, even as though he cried:</p>

<p>“O brother, who would be greater than I! For
what hast thou bartered to me the golden rod of thy
wealth and thy dominion over the flocks and the
herds? For seven chords strung on a shell—for a
melody not even thine own! For a lyre outshone
by my syrinx hast thou sold all thine empire to me.
Will human ears give heed to thy song now thy
sceptre has passed to my hands? Immortal music
only is left thee, and the vision foreseeing the future.
O god! O hero! O fool! what shall these profit
thee now?”</p>

<p>Thus to the artist by whom they had been begotten
the dim white shapes of the deities sometimes
speak. Thus he sees them, thus he hears, whilst
the pale and watery sunlight lights up the form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the toiler in Pherae. For even as it was with the
divinity of Delos, so is it likewise with the genius
of a man, which, being born of a god, yet is bound
as a slave to the grind-stone. Since even as Hermes
mocked the Lord of the Unerring Bow, so is genius
mocked of the world, when it has bartered the
herds, and the grain, and the rod that metes wealth,
for the seven chords that no ear, dully mortal, can
hear.</p>

<p>He can bend great thoughts to take the shapes
that he choose, as the chained god in Pherae bound
the strong kings of the desert and forest to carry his
yoke; yet, like the god, he likewise stands fettered
to the mill to grind for bread.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MAN_ON_A_BICYCLE">THE MAN ON A BICYCLE.</h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The man on a bicycle came panting up a hill at
the beginning of a large town.</p>

<p>“Hello! Knickerbockers,” cried the man on foot;
“do you call that the gait for a scorcher? Why, it
aint more’n a pair uv bars.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, little boy,” returned he of the
wheel.</p>

<p>“Little boy, yourself! Didn’t you know it was
five dollars fine for ridin’ on the sidewalk?”</p>

<p>“Is it? All right? I’ll pay when I come back;”
and the man on a bicycle, encountering a level piece
of road, put an end to further conversation by a sudden
spurt.</p>

<p>But the cyclometer was not to make a steady advance
that evening. A surface crossing lay ahead,
blocked by a belated freight train. The engineer
knew his business and meddled continually with the
throttle. After going about two car-lengths in one
direction, the train would stop, remember something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
left behind, and back up. That is the way to keep
a crowd pacific. Give them plenty to hope for and
they forget to fight.</p>

<p>The wheelman rode in slow circles for a while,
but finding the slush and snow too deep for this exercise,
was forced to a humiliating dismount.</p>

<p>“Misder!” shouted a dirty urchin with a cold,
“did yer know yer ’adn’d god no lighd? Fibe dollars
fine an’ the cop’s in the deepo.”</p>

<p>“O, break away, break away!” snarled the
wheelman.</p>

<p>“Young man,” lisped a willy boy, “I thought
those things weah called in, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wish some one would call <i>that</i> thing in.”</p>

<p>This retort was pointed at the willy boy, and raised
a laugh.</p>

<p>“How long are they going to keep us waiting
here in the cold?” muttered a querulous old gentleman.
“It’s against the law, and the company ought
to be prosecuted.”</p>

<p>“The present company?” ventured a bashful
young man, who was dressed as if going somewhere.</p>

<p>“No, the present company is always excepted,”
came from obscurity.</p>

<p>The man with a bicycle snapped his bell uneasily.
He was in a hurry, of course; if you live much on a
wheel, hurry becomes chronic, engendered perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
by the accustomed sense of rapid motion; but, like
many of his class, he had that fellow feeling for
petty law breakers, which comes by taking chances
against city ordinances.</p>

<p>The fellow at the valve was taking his chances too,
with excellent success. The patience of an American
crowd approaches the miraculous. Fifty engagements
were being broken and ten times as many
toes were freezing, all because one railroader was too
lazy to draw a coupling-pin. Yet so long as the cars
continued to move, no one felt called upon to interfere.</p>

<p>“How many minutes may a crossing legally be
blocked?” demanded the querulous old gentleman,
pulling out his watch.</p>

<p>“Ten, I believe,” answered the flagman, soothingly.</p>

<p>“Ten? Why, we’ve been here most fifteen now!”</p>

<p>“S’posin’ that train on the down track ud move up
just as this un was movin’ away, which ud you have
’rested then?”</p>

<p>The querulous old gentleman looked at the newsboy
reprovingly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Might try and have the president pulled,” suggested
some one.</p>

<p>“What of? The Road? Wopey dick! He’s got
a pull himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>The newsboy smiled approvingly upon his mot,
during a silence that might be felt. It was a relief
when the wind picked up the tones of a brass band,
playing in front of the theatre, and wafted them in
that direction.</p>

<p>“Sub ud oughd to pud runners on thad bike, see?”
volunteered the dirty urchin with a cold.</p>

<p>This aroused the newsboy to a stroke of business.</p>

<p>“New Yawk Evening Sun or Worl! One cent!
Sunorworl?”</p>

<p>Here the bashful young man who was dressed as
if going somewhere, separated himself, and cried:</p>

<p>“Conductor, cut this train in two, or I will have
you arrested.”</p>

<p>“There, you’re done!”</p>

<p>“Cut it short!”</p>

<p>“Go, take a walk!”</p>

<p class="noindent">were expressions which greeted this sally.</p>

<p>The bashful young man took up the thread of his
private life where it had broken off, and wished he
had separated himself further.</p>

<p>A touch on the sleeve aroused the man with a bicycle.
There stood the man on foot.</p>

<p>“Hello! Knickerbockers. Horse tied, eh?
Thought I’d ketch up to you. Where is your century
run? Didn’t I say that there was no scorchin’
gait?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>The man with a bicycle said something that commenced
with “damn,” and then, seeing a pale
frightened-looking girl near by, wished he hadn’t.
In the forgetfulness of his remorse he smirched the
newsboy with his machine.</p>

<p>“You most certainly want to get done hittin’ me
with that there last year’s safety,” began the latter,
speaking loud enough to be heard by all—but his
philippic was cut short by the arrival of train orders,
and the clearing of the road. The man with a bicycle
did a handsome pedal mount and spun skillfully
through the surging mob, catching cries of “See
that burning safety!” “Gimmie a ride, boss?” and
the like, from those left behind. But the man on a
wheel continued to ride.</p>

<p>The man on foot continued to walk.</p>

<p>And the band played on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LET_THERE_BE_GALL_ENOUGH_IN_THY_INK">LET THERE BE GALL ENOUGH IN THY INK.—<i class="smaller">Twelfth Night.</i></h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">’Tis an odd old world, this of ours that is round
like an orange, and slightly flattened at the poles.
It drives not well, and it hath but moderate fondness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
for gall. Why, then, seek to drive it? Why harass
it with the hurtful attrition of gall-dippen pens? For
in truth, its small love for gall is yet greater than its
use therefor. It needs not that we should make it
smart. ’Tis smart enough, and clever enough, already,
towering the hearts of the angels, and affording
a spectacle for the little fishes. Application of gall
will not help it. Rightly used, a little may ease thy
own jaundice, but in thy ink it erodes the pen that
uses it.</p>

<p>Are we vexed at the follies of the round old world?
Is our taste offended by the unripe things written and
painted and sung by those who are not perfect as we
are? We ought to consider the words of the gentle
stoic: “For it is natural that these things should be
done by such persons. It is a matter of necessity,
and if a man will not have it so he will not allow the
fig-tree to have juice.”</p>

<p>To what end do we Philistines write? Is it not because
we are seeking after the truth? Is it not for
the expression of that which to us seems beautiful
and helpful and desirable to be in the world?</p>

<p>And for what, let us suppose, do the armies of the
aliens put pen to paper? Is it not for the same end?
And if they see not purely, do we then hope to clarify
their vision with gall? Rather we ought not to
thwart them in the pursuit of that which seems to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
them excellent and worthy of effort. It is unphilosophic,
and in contravention to the scientific spirit, to
deny others the right which we claim for ourselves.
We ought rather to do the thing which to us seems
lovely, and let that protest, for us, against unloveliness,
by its life and realty—the only effectual protest
this world has ever known. Already there is too
much of strife, too much of denial in the world. Nature
argues the questioning life in the affirmative, for
well she knows, the ancient wise one, that denial is
deadly. “I believe” is the password into the secret
places of good.</p>

<p>The single vision, that sees truest, the simple
heart, that loves it; the direct thought that sends it
forth to bless—the world needs these more than that
we should camp upon its trail with gall in our ink and
our pens tipped with bitterness.</p>

<p>Gall can never fill a vacuum. “If you don’t
want a boy to do that,” said a wise teacher (putting
thumb to nose), “teach him something prettier.”</p>

<p>This, then, must we do for this hulking schoolboy
world of ours; the half-grown, growing world, that
knows enough to recognize that gall is neither good
nor beautiful, yet sees not that the thing it does is, as
well, unlovely.</p>

<p>Let us strive to look out on life with open vision
and simple soul, seeing that it is fair; that no plant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
cometh forth to face the winter’s blight, but when
the winter is over then green, tender things of beauty
push upwards to meet the sunshine—first the blade,
then the ear, and after that the full corn in the ear.
Then cometh the insect, with his drop of gall, and
ugliness and excrescence follow.</p>

<p>That which gives heat and light and blessing; that
which generates force, and yields beauty in the burning
wood that cheers our hearth, is the warm brightness
of the sun’s rays that, in the process of liberating
oxygen into the outer air, were stored up in the
growing tree. If these had not been actually caught
and incorporated in the wood by Nature’s subtle
chemistry, do you think the fire would warm us, sitting
by it?</p>

<p>And that in our literature, and in our art, that shall
make them real, and able to offer coming ages anything
in the warmth and light of this, must be what
we shall manage to incorporate with their growth of
the pure and wholesome, the life-making forces of
our time. Negation is not life. Disease is not
power. Abnormality is not truth. These are forces
that make for death; and life, in its scientific ultimate,
is the sum-total of the forces that resist death.
So, I say again, that work of ours which is to carry
life forward, which is to warm and light the ages,
must be what we can perpetuate of the life-giving,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
growing elements of this one. Let there be gall
enough in thy ink. To what purpose? Gall is not
a promoter of growth. It is a result of hurt, and
where it touches it leaves even a bad thing worse
than it found it.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now it came to pass in the still night watches,
when my body was asleep, that my soul
dreamed a dream.</p>

<p>And in my dream I heard a voice say, “Unstop
his ears that he may hear.”</p>

<p>And I became aware of the presence of an Angel,
and he touched mine ears, saying, “When thou
hearest a sound, a great sound, as of many mighty
waters rushing headlong, listen, and fear nothing.”</p>

<p>Then, verily, did burst on my hearing a mighty
noise, a most discordant frush, and I stretched out
my hand to the Angel, who said, “Fear not! Now
tell me what thou hearest.”</p>

<p>After pondering a long time I turned me to the
Angel and said, “This discordant sound is that of
many and diverse petitions, of which some are directed
to the Eternal but more to the Spirit of Evil.
I further perceive that well-nigh each and every
voice thinks its own tone the right and the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
right tone, and some few voices there be which desire
all the others destroyed. Yet, I hear faintly a few
that are as pure and sweet as the voices of the morning
stars when they sing together.”</p>

<p>And the Angel said, “These are all the voices of
the religions, the sects, the churches, and the individual
hearts, upon your planet. They are many in
number. They are wondrously many in number.
Yet, the understanding of your little heart is darkened:
none of these petitions are directed to the
Spirit of Evil, though only God and we know the
heart of man, and the love of only God is great
enough to forgive your many strange desires. Those
few and sweet voices—ah! those few sweet voices
redeem—redeem the world!”</p>

<p>As I listened again to the strange murmur I wept,
and cried saying, “Would that these voices were as
one!”</p>

<p>And the Angel answered and said, “They will be
when in that state you call ‘Heaven.’”</p>

<p>Then did my soul face eagerly the face of the
Angel and say to him, “They will verily attain
Heaven, then—all these many jangling voices?”</p>

<p>Bending on me a wondering look he answered,
“They will. All who strive for Right and Light
shall be happy. Worship they not all as truly and
deeply as they know? Strive they not all to love—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
be unselfish, although some half-heartedly? From
the north and the south, from the east and the west
shall they be gathered, and there shall carilloux harmonious
ascend to The Eternal, as from one sweet
and glorified tongue.”</p>

<p>And as I listened again I sighed and said, “God
is very patient.”</p>

<p>“God is very patient. He is Love, and his ways
are past finding out,” murmured the Angel.</p>

<p>Again he touched mine ears, saying, “Have you
learned? Go, return to earth, and live in the spirit
of Love. Love, and judge not. Love, and be very
charitable, for you yourself jar on Heaven’s peace.”</p>

<p>And I awoke, and beheld the impartial sun.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> The Sons of Melchizedek are a most peculiar people.</p>

<p>So far as I know the Society for Psychic Research
has not yet taken up the subject of these men who
are without beginning of days or end of time. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
surely it is a most vital theme. These beings who
were never born and cannot die form a tribe that
obeys no natural edict—they are a law unto themselves.
They appear and disappear, like Clangingharp,
to reappear again. Like vagrant comets,
their orbit cannot be determined.</p>

<p>They are visible only under peculiar and extraordinary
conditions. They materialize at will and
disappear without explanation. After a lecture I
have seen one of them rush forward and greet the
speaker with a glow that must have gladdened the
orator’s heart for months. In fact, your son of Melchizedek
is an orator himself and therefore knows
the orator’s need for a fervent word of appreciation
after his “effort.”</p>

<p>Once at a Methodist love feast, when there was a
lull in the program and the minister asked “And is
there not just one more who is willing to add a word
of testimony?” I felt a slight cold feeling go over
me and knew at once that the Unknown was rising
to his feet behind. I heard him clear his throat and
begin with “My friends, I have been thinking while
sitting here,” in a low, musical voice—a voice all
a-tremble with fervor. He spoke for fully fifteen
minutes—spoke with ease, and to the point. At
first there was a craning of necks and whispered
questions as to who he was; but this was soon lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
in admiration. After the service he shook hands
with many, then disappeared, none knew where.</p>

<p>This mysterious being often helps to carry in the
piano, and in crowded street cars he has been known
to supply the necessary nickle when ladies could not
find their pockets. When old gentlemen fall in a
fit on the street, he is on hand. Should a woman
faint in church, he gently carries her out. He opens
the windows in cars, and looks after the ventilator at
all times, and at barbecues and outdoor public meetings
he calls up the stranger to the feast, introducing
shy countrymen to others still more shy, thus thawing
the social ice and making all secure.</p>

<p>When church debts are to be raised he sometimes
arises in his seat and subscribes a large amount. At
mass meetings where volunteers are called for to pass
the hat he always responds. He greets you cordially
on the railway train, shaking hands as he
passes; asks after the wife and babies and shames
you into smirking idiocy because you cannot call him
by name, and as he departs he waves his hand and
charges you thus: “Take care yourself, old man!”</p>

<p>He is always large, usually stout, and the true type
has a dun colored chin whisker. At least he should
have.</p>

<p>He carries a glow of good nature that warms like
wine; he is never cast down, nor is his heart dismayed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
At country funerals he often appears, consoles
the friends, takes care of the flowers, and arranges
the chairs in a column circle against the wall.
At the churchyard he walks with uncovered head by
the side of the clergyman, fetches the reins from the
nearest team to lower the coffin, and handles the
shovel with an unction that savors of joy.</p>

<p>Surely, the Sons of Melchizedek, although not
Philistines, are Peculiar Persons.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> <span class="smcap">She</span>—“Don’t you think him rather thick-headed?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>—(Who has lately been presented with a book
of Familiar Quotations) “Yes, indeed: his head is as
thick as leaves in Vallombrosa.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> The most biting bit of irony that passes as a current
coin is that reference to Boston as a city of culture—or
it would be, were it not for the insight shown in
<i>Paragraphs</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> There were two Ballestiers. The good one, beloved
of the gods (and men), died young; but the
one that resides near Brattleboro will probably live to
be a hundred. Rudyard benefitted the man and as a
sure result got his enmity. He is just literary enough
in his instincts to read his brother-in-law’s books for
gibes and jeers at himself. He imagines that every
villain in the Kipling books is a black attempt to
paint a Beatty Ballestier portrait: not knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
an author (like Diety) creates in his own image. So
the Ballestier reads and rages and cuts hickory clubs
and lies in wait for Mowgli, who dares not venture
out of sight of the bungalow except after dark. Has
Rudyard Kipling written the best he ever will? is a
question that the bad Ballestier proposes to answer
by sending the soul of Kipling to join that of Tomlinson.
Some folks are saying “Good hunting to
you, Kaa Ballestier,” but Kipling in the meantime
has had the rogue elephant put under bonds to keep
the peace, this as preliminary to the killing, should
the rogue continue to fool around the ’rickshaw.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> In the story of “Kate Carnegie,” now running in
<i>The Bookman</i>, Ian Maclaren uses the exclamation
“Dod!” about three times to a page. This is understood
to be a little advertising scheme suggested
by Mr. MacArthur. Your Scot is a very thrifty
person.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> Mr. Percival Pollard who fights in the Commissariat,
and once received a red badge, by being
bumbasted with a pie (although he swears ’twas a
tart) is uttering rank heresy in the <i>New York Journal</i>
concerning Stephen Crane. The statement is
made that Crane is only a producer of “Bloomingdale
symbolistic hash.” But now behold Mr. Pollard
has discovered Nankivell “King of Colorists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and Past Master of all living Draughtsmen”—bless
my soul! when up pops a writer in the <i>Art Amateur</i>
and declares that the only fit man to illustrate The
<i>Black Riders</i> is this same Nankivell.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> They do say that ’Enery James has resolved to
write a novel with an incident. Gosh!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> Is it true that a folio periodical issued in Philadelphia
is to have a serial story entitled, “People Who
Have Bored Me,” and that the first chapters will be
written by Mr. Howells, with comments on Scott,
Dickens, Thackeray, Dumas, Shakespeare, Moses,
Phidias, the critics of the daily papers and Henry
Clay?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> “Algernon wondered vaguely if he had done right
in leaving the handkerchief where she had dropped
it, on the center table. If only it had been the arm
chair, now, what a different complexion it would
have put upon this dilemma—if it was a dilemma—no,
hardly a dilemma, rather a quandary, or even a
question. And she—did she, too, brood upon the
handkerchief? Did she justify herself in dropping
it, in the way she did? He arose, wearily. ‘I
dunno,’ he said, defiantly, yet hopelessly, and sat
down.”—<i>Advance sheets from H. James.</i></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> That the Stage has fallen into a very bad way none
dispute, and under present conditions I cannot do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
better than to commend this ordinance, passed in
London in 1642, to the earnest consideration of His
Honor, the Mayor, and the Honorable Common
Council of the City of New York:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas the Acts of Stage-Plays, Interludes and
Common Plays, Condemned by Ancient Heathens,
and much less to be tolerated amongst Professors of
the Christian Religion, is the occasion of many and
sundry great vices and disorders, tending to the high
provocation of God’s wrath and displeasure, and to
the disturbance of the peace:</p>

<p>Therefore, for the better suppression of the said
Stage-Plays, Interludes, and Common Plays, It is
Ordered and Ordained by the Lords and Commons in
this present Parliament Assembled, and by Authority
of the same, That all Stage-Players, and Players of
Interludes, and common Plays, are hereby declared
to be Rogues, and punishable, within the Statutes of
the thirty-ninth year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth,
and the seventh year of the Reign of King
James, and liable unto the pains and penalties therein
contained, and proscribed against according to the
said Statutes.</p>

<p>And it is further Ordered and Ordained by the
Authority aforesaid, That the Lord Mayor, Justices
of the peace, and Sheriffs of the City of London
and Westminster, and of the Counties of Middlesex
and Surrey, or any two or more of them, shall, and
may, and are hereby, Authorized and required to
pull down and demolish, or cause or procure to be
pulled down and demolished all Stage Galleries,
Seats, and Boxes, erected or used, or which shall be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
erected and used for the acting or playing, or seeing
acted or played, such Stage-Plays, Interludes, and
Plays aforesaid, within the said City of London and
Libertis thereof, and other places within their respective
jurisdictions; and all such common Players,
and Actors of such Plays and Interludes, or any one
of them, or by Oath of two Witnesses shall be proved
before them to have acted or played such Plays and
Interludes as aforesaid at any time thereafter, by
their Warrant or Warrants under their hands and
seals, to cause to be apprehended, and openly and
publicly given forty lashes on the bare back, during
the time of the said Market, and also to cause such
Offenders to enter into Recognizance with two sufficient
Sureties never to act or play any Plays or Interludes
any more, and shall return in the said Recognizance,
or Recognizances, into the Sizes or Sessions
to be then next holden for the said Counties and
Cities respectively. And in case any such person or
persons so convicted of the said offense, shall after
again offend in the same kind, that then the said person
or persons offending, shall be and is hereby declared
to be, and be taken as an Incorrigible Rogue,
and shall be punished and dealt with as an Incorrigible
Rogue ought to be. And it is hereby further
Ordered and Ordained, That all and every sum and
sums of Money gathered, Collected, and taken by
any person or persons, of such persons as shall come
to see, and be Spectators of the said Stage-Plays, and
Interludes, shall be forfeited and paid unto the
Church-Wardens of the Church of the Parish.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> The <i>presciences</i> of the Seventeenth Century often
held morning <i>conversazioni</i>, receiving their callers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
in bed. Like cyclones, fashions have a spiral movement;
and now the good old custom of the <i>presciences</i>
has returned, and like the cyclone, manifests
itself in the West: a Chicago woman giving a weekly
“Thursday Morning.” The bed on which the hostess
languishes is a Louis the Fourteen Times—a gigantic
four poster, with curtains partially drawn.
When each caller is announced a thin blue-veined
hand is held out from behind the curtains, and visions
of a snowy lace-trimmed, Marchale Field night
gown swim before his eyes as the thin hand is reverently
kissed. The room is dimly lighted, the air is
heavy with strange mysterious perfumes and all the
conversation is held in undertone. It may not be
amiss to state also that the coverlet of the bed is a
very modern crazy quilt that has been duly certified
to by a commission de lunatico enquirendo.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> Certainly the people of Boston are a generous
folk: in their walk and conversation they even add
an R to “banana,” and spell “law” with four letters
when three suffice—for hoi polloi.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> The pink tea for Authors was a pretty failure. A
Fictionist standing behind a teacup with a pink tidy
on his chest and pink bows on his legs is a depressive
sight, everywhere but in Philadelphia. But while
five o’clock tea does not work, eleven o’clock beer
is a roaring success.</p>

<p>The papers below specified were, with the exception
of that contributed by the editor, Mr. Hubbard,
originally issued by the late G. P. Putnam, in 1853,
in a book entitled <i>Homes of American Authors</i>. It
is now nearly half a century since this series (which
won for itself at the time a very noteworthy prestige)

feel that no apology is needed in presenting
to a new generation of American readers papers of
such distinctive biographical interest and literary value.</p>

<p class="larger noindent">The ROYCROFT Printing Shop
has in preparation GLYNNE’S
WIFE, a story in verse by Mrs.
Julia Ditto Young.</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Young is a Poet who has written much but
published little. This, her latest and believed by her
friends to be her best work, is the product of a mind
and heart singularly gifted by Nature, and ripened by
a long apprenticeship to Art. As a specimen of the
pure “lyric cry,” illustrating the melody possible in
the English tongue, the volume seems to stand alone
among all books written by modern versifiers. The
delicacy of touch, the faultless rhythm, the splendid
vocabulary and the gentle tho’ sure insight into the
human heart, make a combination of qualities very,
very seldom seen. The author <i>knows</i>, and knowing
blames not: a sustained sympathy being the keynote
of it all.</p>

<p>The publishers have endeavored to give the story
a typographical setting in keeping with the richness
of the lines. Five hundred and ninety copies are
being printed on smooth Holland hand-made paper,
and twenty-five on Tokio Vellum. The copies on
Holland paper will be bound in boards covered with
antique watered silk; the Vellum copies are bound
in like manner save that each will bear on the cover
a special water-color design done by the hand of the
author.</p>

<p>The price of the five hundred and ninety copies is
two dollars each; the Vellum copies five dollars
each. Every copy will be numbered and signed by
Mrs. Young. Orders are now being recorded and
will be delivered on September 1st, numbered in the
order received.</p>
